Hi there, I've been contemplating the convergence of generative text and imagery. This led me to the idea of asking AI about the regrets of elderly people and how they visually perceive them. As part of this experiment, I'm learning Rust to implement a filter function called **noir** and delve deeper into **standard image processing techniques**. I encourage you to explore each image, as they offer fascinating insights into AI's interpretation of emotions and visuals. Enjoy these creations while AI is still [evolving](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/08/10/there-is-no-hard-takeoff.html).
