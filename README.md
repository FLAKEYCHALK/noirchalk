# NOIRCHALK

This is an image gallery, or you can treat it like a trashy museum, where you can see how AI interprets the regrets of old people visually. This thought explores when AI will truly understand what it means to be human. While AI hasn't reached that point yet, enjoy observing the flaws it still has during this time. The tool that I've used is [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) where my goal is to develop a filter function called '[noir(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noir)]' and expand my knowledge of standard image processing techniques.
